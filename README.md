# End-to-End Data Analytics Pipeline using Python, SQL, and Power BI

This project aims to replicate a real-world, enterprise-level data analytics pipeline by converting raw data into meaningful business insights. The workflow covers the complete lifecycle of analytics, including:

Data Preparation & Exploratory Analysis (Python): Preprocess, clean, and structure the raw dataset, followed by exploratory analysis to uncover initial patterns and data quality issues.

Analytical Processing (SQL): Emulate business operations by executing SQL queries that reveal customer behavior, segmentation, retention factors, and key purchase patterns.

Visualization & Decision Insights (Power BI): Develop an interactive dashboard that presents trends, metrics, and business indicators in a visually compelling format, enabling informed decision-making for stakeholders.
